Jam icons is a set of SVG icons designed for web projects, illustrations, print projects, etc. Licensed under MIT.
Icons: [https://jam-icons.com](https://jam-icons.com)

## What's new?

Support for font and JS has been dropped to focus on SVG only (v3). The idea is to simplify the current package, believing that SVG / inline SVG is the principal way to go when it comes to web icons.

## Usage
